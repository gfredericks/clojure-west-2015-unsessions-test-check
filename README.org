** Basic Intro
   The test.check README probably has a lot of material for this.
*** Basic Generators
**** Scalars
**** Collections
*** Generator Combinators
**** fmap
**** bind
**** such-that
*** Properties
** High Level sales pitch, experience report
   - General
     - Test lots of edge cases at once
     - Drawbacks
       - Big investment
       - Harder to understand your tests
   - Large-scale
     - Value of modeling your system
       - Exposes assumptions
     - Eventual support for testing concurrent processes?
     - Drawbacks
       - Testing large-scale things can be very slow feedback
         - Particularly w.r.t. shrinking
       - Complex generators don't always shrink very well

** Future Design / Improvements
*** Numerics
    The big problem currently is with the distribution of the numeric
    generators. E.g., gen/int probably only generates numbers between
    -200 and 200, which is definitely not sufficient for all
    applications.

    How do we create a set of generators that can cover most/all
    common distributional needs but not suffer from some sort of
    overwhelming combinatorial API complexity problem?

    Example distributions:
    - ALL possible doubles
      - Shrinking towards what?
    - Some other natural distribution of doubles?
    - ALL possible longs
    - Some particular range of ratios?
      - Maybe an upper bound on the absolute value of the numerator
        and denominator?
    - Big decimals? Maybe with a specific precision and upper bound
      on absolute value?
    - Is there a use for generating unbounded bigints and ratios?
      - How would the user control the distribution?
      - For that matter what would this even mean w.r.t. the 'size'
        parameter? Should we have a pattern for things that are
        unbounded regardless of size, but where size determines the
        "expected" size of the thing?
*** Shrinking
*** Testing generators
    How to assert that a generator "probably" generates a particular
    kind of thing?
